### General Info
The ability to interoperate is one of the most important aspects of web applications. Your online bank system is made up of dozens of internal systems. The country of Iceland offers various services that run in completely different systems. When you search your destination on Google Maps, you are actually using multiple systems, and even io.tskoli.dev is made up of 2 different systems.      
That means that the ability of connecting softwares is crucial to generate the powerful and diverse range of services that exist on the web today.

The mechanism through which these systems are able to do this is called API - Application Programming Interface -, an abstract term to designate a way for one system to use the resources or functionalities of another. 

In this Project, each group will create an application which connects to other applications making use of APIs, in order to amplify the uses and potential of their own product.
